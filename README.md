This is a guide to making compact and sleek documents in Markdown. Markdown was created by **John Gruber** and **Aaron Swartz**.

Markdown is very different from other **word processors**. Word processors usually have *GUI* to modify text and lock up documents in a proprietary file format. Markdown, however, is universal and can be **rendered on *any* device**. It needs no GUI; all it needs is a Markdown editor, which can be found in a lot of places. There are many online ones available, like [Replit](https://replit.com) and [Github](https://github.com). Many offline Markdown editing applications are also available.

Markdown is designed so that even without a renderer, it is readable. That's why it is such a good language to know if you are into writing.

Markdown is also used widely in web development. Markdown was used to create the very page you are on right now. Many libraries for languages like **Javascript** can help Markdown be displayed on a page instead of **HTML**, or with a service like [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), which this site is hosted on.
